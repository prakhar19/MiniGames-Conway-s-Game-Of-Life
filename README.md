This is a simple representation of the Conway's Game Of Life on a finite square grid, made using JAVA. The original game consists of an infinite grid.

The size of the grid can be specified using command-line parameters. The format for doing so is,

```
java ConwaysGameOfLife GRID_SIZE COLUMN_SIZE
```

where, `GRID_SIZE` is the number of rows/columns, and `COLUMN_SIZE` is the size of each column in pixels.
