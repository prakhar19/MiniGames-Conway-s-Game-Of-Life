I made this for a submission to one of my college projects.

A simple representation of the Conway's Game Of Life (for more info, go here: http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/) on a finite square grid, made using JAVA. The original game consists of an infinite grid.

The size of the grid can be altered using command-line parameters. The format is,

```
java ConwaysGameOfLife GRID_SIZE COLUMN_SIZE
```

where, `GRID_SIZE` is the number of rows/columns, and `COLUMN_SIZE` is the size of each column in pixels.
